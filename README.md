DESCRIPTION OF TASK 1: 
As part of the CodTech internship program, I successfully completed Internship Task 1 titled "API Integration and Data Visualization", which involved fetching real-time data from a public API and visualizing it using Python. I began this task by selecting the OpenWeatherMap API, a free and widely used public API that provides weather forecast data for any city around the world. I created an account on the OpenWeatherMap website and generated a unique API key, which was then used to authenticate and access weather data programmatically. To write and test the code, I used the Jupyter Notebook platform, which is part of the Anaconda distribution, as it allows for interactive code execution, inline visualization, and detailed documentation of the workflow. I also installed essential Python libraries including requests for making API calls, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and pandas for organizing data efficiently. After obtaining the API key, I constructed the correct API request URL by incorporating the API key and city name (e.g., Hyderabad) into the endpoint URL. Using the requests library, I fetched 5-day weather forecast data, and parsed the JSON response to extract relevant information like temperature and time. I then used matplotlib and seaborn to generate a line graph that showed the temperature trend over time. This visualization provides clear insights into weather patterns and can be used in various real-world applications such as travel planning apps, agricultural forecasting systems, smart city dashboards, and environmental monitoring platforms. In terms of tools, I primarily used Python, Jupyter Notebook, and OpenWeatherMap API, and I leveraged visualization libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to turn raw JSON data into insightful graphical representations. Throughout the project, I also practiced error handling and validated the API response to make sure the data was correctly fetched. This project helped me improve my practical knowledge of API handling, JSON parsing, and real-time data visualization — all of which are essential skills in modern data science and application development. Moreover, it strengthened my confidence in working with external APIs, understanding data flow, and creating user-friendly data displays. Overall, this task was not just a technical exercise but also a demonstration of how APIs and data visualization play a crucial role in real-world software development and analytics. The skills and tools I used in this task are highly applicable in fields like weather apps, financial dashboards, health monitoring systems, IoT-based data analysis, and AI-driven predictive systems. Completing this task gave me hands-on experience in backend data handling and front-end visualization — a combination that is extremely valuable in full-stack development and data engineering careers. The project was completed independently using self-research, official documentation, and debugging techniques, which helped me become more resourceful and confident in my technical abilities. I plan to extend this work further by integrating additional data sources and deploying the visualization dashboard as a mini web app using tools like Streamlit or Flask.
